## Quickstart

There are five ways to use SPMF, depending on your needs:

---

### Build and run this source checkout on Windows

This repository contains source code rather than a pre-built `spmf.jar`. The
course environment uses JDK 25 and does not require Maven, Gradle, or external
Java libraries.

1. Verify that JDK 25 is available:

   ```powershell
   java -version
   javac -version
   ```

2. Build all Java source files from the repository root:

   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build.ps1
   ```

   SPMF source files contain comments written with mixed legacy encodings. The
   script therefore compiles using `ISO-8859-1`; this preserves the source bytes
   and does not affect the Java algorithm logic.

3. Launch the graphical user interface:

   ```powershell
   java -cp "build\classes;." ca.pfv.spmf.gui.Main
   ```

   The `.` classpath entry lets the GUI load icons kept alongside the source.

4. To run the baseline for this project from the GUI, click **Select**, search
   for `Scented`, and select **ScentedUtilityMiner**. Use:

   ```text
   Input:  ca\pfv\spmf\test\DB_Utility.txt
   Output: results\scented-output.txt
   Minimum utility: 30
   Max. Reinduction count: 10
   ```

   The sample run produces 8 high-utility itemsets. Its output is a local,
   reproducible experiment artifact and is intentionally not versioned.

The `build/` and `results/` directories are generated locally and ignored by
Git.

---

### 1 — Graphical User Interface (GUI)

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/case1.png" alt="SPMF GUI use case" width="600">
</div>

The most simple way to use SPMF is through its integrated GUI.  To run the GUI:
1) Download the files `spmf.jar` and `test_files.zip` to your computer and make sure that Java is installed on your computer.   Alternatively, if you do not want to install Java or cannot install it, an EXE version of SPMF is available for Windows on the release page, which includes the Java runtime and behaves in the same way as `spmf.jar` .
2) Uncompress the file `test_files.zip` on your desktop. It will create a folder containing some example data files that you can use with the algorithms to try the examples from the documentation.
3) Launch the GUI of SPMF by double-clicking on the file `spmf.jar`. If it does not work and you are using Windows, right-click on `spmf.jar` and select "open with..." and then select "Java Platform". If this option is not there, perhaps that Java is not installed on your computer, or that the PATH environment variable does not include your Java installation. 
4) If the previous step succeeds, the graphical interface of SPMF will open: 

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/gui.png" alt="SPMF GUI" width="600">
</div>

5) Then, from the user interface, you can select input files, choose an algorithm from more than 300 algorithms, sets its parameters, and run the algorithms. For example, let's say that you want to run the **CM-SPAM** algorithm.   In the [documentation](https://philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=documentation.php), it is the [CM-SPAM example](https://philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/CM-SPAM.php). To run that example:
   
 - Click on the combo box beside **"Choose an algorithm"** and select **"CM-SPAM"**.  
 - Click on **"Choose input file"** and select `contextPrefixSpan.txt` from the `test_files` folder.  
 - Click on **"Choose output file"**, select a location (e.g., Desktop), enter `result.txt`, and click **"OK"**.
 - Set the parameter **minsup (%)** to `0.5` (as in the example).  
 - Other parameters are optional and can be ignored for this example.  
 - Click on **"Run algorithm"**.  
 - A new window will open showing the results.  
 - The results correspond to the patterns discovered by CM-SPAM (see the [CM-SPAM example](https://philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/CM-SPAM.php) of the documentation for interpretation).
That’s all. To run another algorithm, follow the same steps.

---

### 2 — Command Line

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/case2.png" alt="SPMF command line case" width="600">
</div>

The second to use SPMF is through its command line interface (CLI) from the console.  To run the SPMF using the CLI:
1) Download the files `spmf.jar` and `test_files.zip` to your computer and make sure that Java is installed on your computer.    Alternatively, if you do not want to install Java or cannot install it, an EXE version of SPMF is available for Windows on the release page, which includes the Java runtime and behaves in the same way as `spmf.jar` .
2) Uncompress the file `test_files.zip` on your desktop. It will create a folder containing some example data files that you can use with the algorithms.
3) To run an algorithm, go to the [documentation](https://philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=documentation.php) of SPMF  find the example corresponding to the algorithm that you want to run. For example, let's say that you want to run the **PrefixSpan** algorithm. It is this [example](https://philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/PrefixSpan.php) in the [documentation](https://philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=documentation.php).
5) Open the command prompt (if you are using Windows) or the terminal (if you are using Linux). Then, type the command specified in the example. For example, for PrefixSpan, the command is:
   
    ```java -jar spmf.jar run PrefixSpan contextPrefixSpan.txt output.txt 50%```
  
This command means to run the algorithm named "PrefixSpan" to use the input file named "contextPrefixSpan.txt" to set the output file for the results as "output.txt" to set the parameter of the algorithm (minsup) to 50 %. After executing this command, the file output.txt will be created. It will contain the result.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/cmd.png" alt="SPMF console" width="600">
</div>


The input and output file format of each algorithm is described in the  [documentation](https://philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=documentation.php).

That's all. If you want to run another algorithm, then follow the same steps.

---

### 3 — Java API

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/case3.png" alt="SPMF Java API use case" width="600">
</div>

The third way to use SPMF is by integrating it into Java projects. For this, you can download `spmf.jar` and include it in the classpath of your Java project, and then call the classes from SPMF from your Java program. Or alternatively, you can download `spmf.zip` or clone the project to obtain SPMF source code. 
To get a good grasp of how the source code of SPMF is organized, you may read the [developers guide](http://philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=developers.php).

In general, each algorithm in SPMF is organized in its own package containing the main implementation files. Some utility classes are shared across multiple algorithms and are located in common directories such as `ca/pfv/spmf/input/` and `ca/pfv/spmf/patterns/`.  To how to run one algorithm from the source code, consider the SPAM algorithm. It is implemented in the package `ca/pfv/spmf/algorithms/sequentialpatterns/spam`, which is itself a subpackage of `ca/pfv/spmf/algorithms/sequentialpatterns/`, reflecting the fact that SPAM belongs to the family of sequential pattern mining algorithms. 

Each algorithm follows a consistent design pattern. There is a main class whose name starts with `Algo`, and this class provides a method called `runAlgorithm()` to execute the algorithm. For example, the SPAM algorithm is implemented in the class `AlgoSPAM.java`. Its `runAlgorithm()` method expects three parameters: the path to the input file, the path to the output file, and a minimum support threshold.
To understand how an algorithm is executed in practice, one can examine the example files located in the directory `ca/pfv/spmf/test/`. This directory contains demonstration code intended for developers. Each algorithm typically has at least one corresponding test file named `MainTestXXXX.java`, where `XXXX` is the name of the algorithm. 

In the case of SPAM, the relevant example is `MainTestSPAM_saveToFile.java`.

Example code of how to run the SPAM algorithm:

```java
// Load a sequence database
String input = fileToPath("contextPrefixSpan.txt");
String output = ".//output.txt";

// Create an instance of the algorithm
AlgoSPAM algo = new AlgoSPAM();

// Execute the algorithm with minsup = 2 sequences (50%)
algo.runAlgorithm(input, output, 0.5);
algo.printStatistics();
```

In this example, the input file `contextPrefixSpan.txt` corresponds to the dataset used in the official documentation and can be found in the `ca/pfv/spmf/tests/` directory. The output file is written to `.//output.txt`, although this path can be replaced by any valid location on the user’s system. The call to `runAlgorithm()` triggers the execution of the algorithm. The value `0.5` represents the minimum support threshold, whose exact interpretation is described in the SPAM documentation. Finally, each algorithm is associated with a description class located in the package `ca/pfv/spmf/algorithmmanager/descriptions`. These classes provide metadata such as the authors of the algorithm, the expected input and output formats, the list of parameters, and instructions for execution. They play an important role in the system: the graphical user interface relies on them to dynamically populate the list of available algorithms, while the command-line interface uses them to inform users about the required parameters and usage details. For instance, the SPAM algorithm is documented by the class `DescriptionAlgoSPAM`.
Other algorithms can be run in a similar way.

The input and output file format of each algorithm is described in the  [documentation](https://philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=documentation.php).

### 4 — Wrappers for Other Languages

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/case4.png" alt="SPMF wrappers use case" width="600">
</div>

The fourth way to use SPMF is to call it from language developed using other programming languages using   wrappers for **Python, R, C#, etc.** via community-provided wrappers that invoke the command-line interface of SPMF.
A list of wrappers is [here](https://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=spmfwrappers.php).

---

### 5 — REST API via SPMF-Server *(new)*

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/spmf-server.png" alt="SPMF-Server framework" width="600">
</div>

The fifth way to use SPMF is through the **[SPMF-Server](https://github.com/philfv9/spmf-server)**, a lightweight
HTTP server that wraps the SPMF library and exposes all algorithms as a **REST API**. This lets any language or tool submit mining jobs over HTTP and retrieve results without needing a local Java integration. This can be useful to run SPMF on a remote machine and query it from a client, from the browser or integrate it into a web application or microservice. 
Currently, the SPMF server can be used with the [SPMF Server Python CLI and GUI clients](https://github.com/philfv9/spmf-server-pythonclient) or  the [SPMF Server Web client](https://github.com/philfv9/spmf-server-webclient). 

For details about how to install and run the SPMF-Server, please see the [SPMF-Server](https://github.com/philfv9/spmf-server) project.

## Architecture

A general overview of the architecture of SPMF is provided below.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/spmf_architecture.jpg" alt="SPMF architecture"">
</div>

To use SPMF, a user can choose to use the Graphical interface, Command line interface or the SPMF-server. The user interacts with any of these interfaces to run algorithms which are managed by a module called the Agorithm Manager. There are mainly three types of algorithms, which are (1) data pre-processing algorithms, (2) data mining algorithms, and (3) algorithms to either visualize data or patterns found in the data. The Algorithm Manager has the list of all available algorithms, and a description of each algorithm. The description of an algorithm indicates how many parameters it has, what are the data  types of parameters, what is the algorithm name, etc. The input and output of algorithms are generally text files. A few different formats are supported, explained in the documentation of SPMF.

The source code is organized in several packages. The main packages are:
```
